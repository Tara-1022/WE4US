Regularly:
- Update and note the initial password (use a password generation tool like LastPass) in constants.py
- Update CSV with newer form responses
- Run user generation script
- Send out a mail to the newest batch of users asking them to use the password reset feature to set password and login. (In case of any issue, the noted initial password can be used by a dev/admin but is NOT to be shared to the user)
- Update the form responses excel sheet (by marking all completed rows a new color)

Since this is a closed site, we can expect a fixed number of users and this workflow, though manual, should suffice.
